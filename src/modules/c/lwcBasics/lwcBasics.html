          <!-- Each item must have a key using the key directive. It must be a string/number, and must be unique -->
          <li class="info-holder" key={guitarist.name}>
            <div class="info">{guitarist.name}</div>

        <p>Using the iterator directive, we can do special functionality on the first and last elements!</p>
        <!-- The iterator directive works like for:each, but can perform special actions on the first and last value -->

          <li key={myiterator.value.name}>

            <!-- Combining the if:true|false directive with the first and last -->
            <hr if:true={myiterator.first} />
            {myiterator.value.name}
            <hr if:true={myiterator.last} />

<!-- Lets take a moment to speak about the Shadow DOM -->
<!--
     The Shadow DOM is a modern design standard that will provide encapsulation for your component. Each component has its own 
     Shadow DOM, the structure of which is called the shadow tree. The Shadow DOM begins and ends with the shadow boundary.
     
     So what happens at the shadow boundary? A few things:
     - CSS styles stop cascading
     - Events bubbling up and crossing the boundary will change property values to match the listening scope
       - This is called event retargeting. The value of Event.target normally holds the element that was the target of the
         event. For example, if you were to click on a <p> tag, the target would be that <p> tag. If this was not changed,
         it would bypass the encapsulation of the Shadow DOM. So instead, this property is changed once the event bubbles
         past the shadow boundary. So instead, the event is retargeted to the first element outside of the shadow boundary
     - Elements passed via a Slot bypasses the shadow boundary
     - Elements in the shadow tree cannot be queried for. A component can query for elements in its shadow tree using
       the this.template.querySelector() method.
